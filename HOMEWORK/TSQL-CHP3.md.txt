1. In general, why would you even want to join two (or more) tables together? This is a good time to think about the nature of relational algebra.
- Joining two tables to complete 

2. Describe in your own words the output from an inner join.
- it selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the colums.

3. Describe in your own words the output from an outer join.
-  outer join returns all rows from the left table with the matching rows in the right table

4. Describe in your own words the output from an cross join.
- cross join only uses one logical query processsing phase / mutliply the rows

5. A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is “Ohio.” Why is this true?
- outer/one Hi/left,right,full Outer/cross

6. Give an example of a composite join.
- multiple join conditions
- from dbo.Table1 as T1 
	INNER JOIN dbo.Table2 AS T2 
	ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 
	AND T1.col2 = T2.col2

7. What is the diﬀerence between the following two queries? The business problem is “How many orders do we have from each customer?”
- The two queries return the same informtion in the tables 
- The tables display how many orders each customer has ordered, so the question is answered.

================first query===============
 
SELECT C.custid, COUNT(*) AS numorders 
FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.
Orders AS O 
ON C.custid = O.custid 
GROUP BY C.custid; 



================second query=============== 
SELECT C.custid, COUNT(O.orderid) AS numorders 
FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O 
ON C.custid = O.custid 
GROUP BY C.custid;



8. What might be one reason the following query does not return the column custID in this query?
- The is query will give you a error message becasue the where clause should be written as follows:
WHERE O.orderdate >= N'20160101';
-might not be in orderdate 

SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, O.orderid, O.orderdate
FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O 
ON C.custid = O.custid 
WHERE O.orderdate >= ’20160101’;
